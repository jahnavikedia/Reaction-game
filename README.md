# reaction-game
 A 2-player reaction game. The game will have two players, one of whom controls the game using the A key, and the other with the L key.  When the Start button is pressed, a spinner is displayed for a random amount of time between 5 and 10 seconds. After that time, a message will appear saying "PLAYERS GO!!" â€” once this happens, the first player to press their control button will win the game.
